Hereâ€™s an implementation of a "Guess the Number" game in Java with an attractive GUI and a scoring system. 
This game allows the player to guess a randomly generated number, provides feedback on whether the guess is 
too high or too low, and includes a scoring system based on the number of attempts made.

We will use JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JButton, and JTextField components from javax.swing to create the GUI.

Run: java GuessTheNumberGame.java

That's Attractive GUI when Run:
